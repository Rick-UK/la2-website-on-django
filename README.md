# La2 website on Django

This is my personal project for practice during development, as well as an example of my work for employers during interviews.  
I do not grant anyone the right to use it for personal or commercial purposes.  

## Setup Instructions  

Before starting this project, create a `.env` file next to the `manage.py` file and add the following variables:  

```env
DB_NAME=la2website_db
DB_USER=la2website_user
DB_PASSWORD=123456
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
